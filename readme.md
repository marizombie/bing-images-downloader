## Bing images downloader

To work with script, put your bing image search API key to `api_key.py` near the `downloader.py` and assign it to `image_search_api_key` variable.
Install requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Specify `query` parameter to start your search.
`Destination folder` can be chosen, by default it creates `downloads` folder near the script.
Another argument is `images limit`, bing allows `150` images to be downloaded at a time, so it is default value.
